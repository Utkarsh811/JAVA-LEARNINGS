String  s1=new String("utkarsh");
=>In this case 2 objects will be created one is in heap and other one is in SCP(String constant pool)
HEAP                   SCP
s1-->utkarsh           utkarsh
s2="utkarsh" ;(known as String literal)
Inthis case only object is created in the SCP and s2 always referring that object

Whenever we use a new operator a new object always created in the heap
There maybe a chance of existing two objects with same name on the heap but there is no chance of existing 2 objects with same name on SCP.
 HEAP                                   SCP
