Math.pow always return float value.
use nextLine for reading string with spaces and next for reading only a word.

In Java there is data structure called Hashmap ,
like python have dictionary java has Hashmap
it stores key-value pair only.
It has a function put() to insert or update in the hasmap .if that key  is present in the hashmap then updation will happen
if(key not present)then insertion will be done.
ThERE IS NO ORDER in the hashmap .

Hashmap <String,Integer> mydict=new Hashmap<>()
mydict.put("hello",3232)

//ArrayList<Character> liist=new ArrayList<Character>(mydict.keySet());   //vasuumiet
        // System.out.println(mydict.get(liist.get(0)));
//
***Use long data type in questions to avoid errors. most common mistake

******Java Stdin and Stdout II
int i = scan.nextInt();
double d = scan.nextDouble();
*********scan.nextLine();
String s = scan.nextLine();

*******After supplying data for int, we would hit the enter key. What nextInt() and nextDouble() does is it assigns integer to appropriate variable and keeps the enter key unread in thekeyboard buffer. so when its time to supply String the nextLine() will read the enter key from the user thinking that the user has entered the enter key.(that's we get empty output) . Unlike C, there is no fflush() to clean buffer, so we have to flush by not taking it in variable.

.hasNext() method in java used with scanner class
https://www.javatpoint.com/post/java-scanner-hasnext-method


some important code working
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    static Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    static int b=sc.nextInt();
     static int h=sc.nextInt();
     static boolean flag=true;
     static{try{
         if(b<=0 || h<=0){
             flag=false;
             throw new Exception("Breadth and height must be positive");
         }
         
     }
     catch(Exception e){
         System.out.println(e);
     }}
    

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        int area;
        if(flag){
            area=b*h;
            System.out.println(area);
            
        }
        
        
    }
}

*Use TreeMap to store sorted HashMap with respect to keys
*Use Collection.sort() to sort ArrayList
*Use TreeSet to use sorted HashSet

OverLoaded methods
Methods overloading means methods that share the same name but have different parameters
method name+parameters=method signatures
FINAL KEYWORD->in other programming languages we have constant whereas in java we have final.
OverLoaded Constructors
methods that share same name but different parameters
name+parameter=signature

DESTRUCTOR IN Java
In java we use constructor to create the objects.if this retain in memory then it would be a waste of memory
Destructor is  used to deallocate the objects.It frees up the memory.
In java this work is done implicitly by the JVM USING THe garbage collector.
But  we can also do this work explicitely by using the finalize() keyword
