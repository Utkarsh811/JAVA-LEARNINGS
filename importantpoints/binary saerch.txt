 mid=lower+(higher-lower)/2;
 In binary search this basically used to avoid the interger overflow ,
 suppose you used int for storing lower and higher and then you  used lower + higher .
 at some point the result will overflow the value integer limit so we do higher - lower 
 which basically means the same as mid.
