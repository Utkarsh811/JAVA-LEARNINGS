Arrays size is fixed
Inserting element into an array can be expensive
Advantage of linked list over arrays-:1. dynamic size 2. ease of insertion and deletion

Disadvantages over arrays 1. accessing elements are difficult O(n) 2. Require extra space for pointers 


conclusion
linked list gives you better performance in case of large size of array . for small size 
ArrayList is beneficial


Use of Linkedlist
*We mostly uses LinkedList while switching the tabs,in image gallary left and right 
*In implementation of Stacks and Queues
*In HashMap and HashSet

LINKED LIST   VERSIS  Arrays

1. Linked List are more memory efficient than Arrays as which declaring the arrays , we require a large chunk of memory but 
for creation of linkedlist we need a chunk for a single node.

2. For accessing elements of particular index ->
In case of arrays , we can access in O(1)
In case of LinkedList , we have to traverse from head till the index.

3. Deletion and Insertion operation in the arrays is costly in terms of time whereas in case of linkedlist
it is efficient.

4. When have insertion ,deletion problems we use LinkedList , but for sorting problems we use arrays
as we have merge sort
