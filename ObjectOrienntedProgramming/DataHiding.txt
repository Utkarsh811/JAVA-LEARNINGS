Data Hiding
Just like while watching the television , you enjoy the functionalities as by using the buttons,
you dont need to learn the interior functionality or do some changes in the circuitary .
it would be difficult for the user while using the product , he have to learn it before using that
 so Data hiding 
 alllows you to hide the data .

In java we make data members private by writing
private int  volume; so datamembers can only be accessible in that class only not in other class
 Constructors


 Constructor is method of a class which automatically called when "object is created"
 >Constructor is method which has same name as classname
 > a method have return type but a constructor method have no return type
 eg

 class Rect{
     private int length;
     private int breadth;  //data hiding

     public Rect(){   //this is a non parameterized constructor 
         length=9;    // beware that constructor should have same name as class
         breadth=90;  // constructor is automatically called when new object is created

     }
 }
 class Test{
     public static void main(String args[]){
         Rect r=new Rect();
     }
 }
