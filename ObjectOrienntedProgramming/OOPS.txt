Principles of Object Oriented Programming Language
#1 Abstraction-Hiding Internal details and showing only required features 
#2 Encapsulation
#3 Polimorphism
#4 Inheritance 


Encapsulation-Take an example of television, all the wirings and monitoe screen abstraction , non hidden features all
kept in one box. The way of putting everything in one box is called Encapsulation.


Inheritence  -> Adding something new features in a something make that thing new .
eg-> You can see the old computers , all the new computers are inherited from the old because main circuitery is same just there is differnce in new feautures and changes done in new computers.
Specialization === Inheritance
Generalization === Polimorphism


Object/Classes
 Object is defined by its Properties and behaviours

 Class - design of something, blueprint . you can create various objects from that. (on paper)
 object - it is real based entity (really existed)
 From one class you can create as many objects you want


 class television{
     private int volume;  //data member
     private int channel; //data member

     static int volume(){  //methods

     }
     static int channel(){   //methods

     }
 }


 class test{
     public static void main(String args[]){
         //object creation of television
         television t =new television();
         // t->reference
 
         
     }   
 }
