Math.pow always return float value.
use nextLine for reading string with spaces and next for reading only a word.

In Java there is data structure called Hashmap ,
like python have dictionary java has Hashmap
it stores key-value pair only.
It has a function put() to insert or update in the hasmap .if that key  is present in the hashmap then updation will happen
if(key not present)then insertion will be done.
ThERE IS NO ORDER in the hashmap .

Hashmap <String,Integer> mydict=new Hashmap<>()
mydict.put("hello",3232)
