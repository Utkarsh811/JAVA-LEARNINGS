int to String in java


Here are 3 ways to convert an int to a String

String s = String.valueOf(n);
String s = Integer.toString(n);
String s = "" + n;
We know that "" is of type String. It is known as the empty string. It is a String with no characters in it. The + operator, when used on the right side of a String, simply connects stuff to the right of the original String. If what it's connecting is not yet a String, it automatically converts it into one, which is what we want for this exercise.

"" + "Hello" + "there."
becomes the String "Hello there." and

"" + n
becomes the String n, where n was automatically converted into a String for us.
